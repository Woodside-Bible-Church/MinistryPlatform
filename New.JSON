Through explaining Luke's record of the Gospel's advancement and church expansion, Wiersbe opens the door to understanding the work of the church today.\n\nUsing hard-hitting quotes from recognized names like St. Augustine and John Bunyan, Wiersbe proves himself as a well-read author and gifted writer.  The depth of his study is astounding, yet the accessibility of his text for every age group is evident as well.  He proves what Luke intended-for Acts to be interpreted not as the apostles' glorious acts, but as the life-changing acts of the Holy Spirit.  The same Spirit lives in believers today, the same God calls followers to expand His church, and the same basic problems still arise within the church, but the same power available then is still available now to change the nations.\n\nBe Daring (Acts 13-28): Readers travel through dungeon prisons, see the ancient world as if it were today, and witness the marvelous work God can do through a few souls fully surrendered to His purposes.  They witness Paul's conversion and spot his imperfections, yet still they enter his successes as the Lord uses Him to preach Good News to the lost and dying.  Because there are hardships today, places where God is unwelcome, and people whose hearts are unreceptive, both young and old will benefit from knowing that Paul's God is their God-the God of the ages. They will persevere till the finish line to \"win the prize for which God [calls them] heavenward in Christ Jesus\" (Philippians 4:13).",
