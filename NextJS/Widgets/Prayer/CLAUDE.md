   - Common errors and fixes

2. This document (CLAUDE.md) - Project-specific architecture and features

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js-based prayer request widget that integrates with MinistryPlatform's Feedback table. It can be embedded on WordPress sites without iframes and provides a modern, mobile-friendly interface for submitting and viewing prayer requests.

**Key Innovation:** Uses custom `Feedback_Entry_User_Responses` table to track who prayed for what, enabling personalized features like prayer counts, streaks, and prayer history.

## Architecture

### Authentication
- Uses **MinistryPlatform's native Login Widget** (`<mpp-user-login>`) for authentication
- The login widget stores the auth token in `localStorage` as `mpp-widgets_AuthToken`
- Token is validated against MP's `/widgets/Api/Auth/User` endpoint
- No NextAuth session management - purely client-side token validation

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates via MP Login Widget (stored in WordPress page)
2. Token is stored in localStorage automatically
3. React app reads token from localStorage (`mpWidgetAuthClient.ts`)
4. API routes validate token with MP (`mpWidgetAuth.ts`)
5. Prayer data is fetched/created via MP REST API (`prayerService.ts`)

### Key Files

**Authentication:**
- `/src/lib/mpWidgetAuthClient.ts` - Client-side token management (reads from localStorage)
- `/src/lib/mpWidgetAuth.ts` - Server-side token validation (validates with MP)

**Data Layer:**
- `/src/providers/MinistryPlatform/entities/Feedback.ts` - Feedback entity operations
- `/src/providers/MinistryPlatform/entities/FeedbackSchema.ts` - Zod schemas for validation
- `/src/services/prayerService.ts` - High-level prayer service layer

**API Routes:**
- `/src/app/api/prayers/route.ts` - GET (list) and POST (create) prayers
- `/src/app/api/prayers/[id]/route.ts` - GET, PATCH, DELETE individual prayers
- `/src/app/api/prayers/[id]/approve/route.ts` - POST to approve (staff only)
- `/src/app/api/categories/route.ts` - GET prayer categories (Feedback Types)

**UI Components:**
- `/src/components/prayer/MPWidgetAuthWrapper.tsx` - Checks for localStorage token
- `/src/components/prayer/PrayerForm.tsx` - Submit new prayer requests
- `/src/components/prayer/PrayerCard.tsx` - Individual prayer with swipe functionality
- `/src/components/prayer/PrayerList.tsx` - List or stack of prayers with filtering

**Main Page:**
- `/src/app/(app)/page.tsx` - Main prayer wall interface

## MinistryPlatform Integration

### Database Tables

**Core Tables (Built into MP):**
- **Feedback_Entries** - Stores prayer requests and praise reports
  - `Feedback_Entry_ID` (Primary Key)
  - `Contact_ID` (Foreign Key to Contacts)
  - `Feedback_Type_ID` (Foreign Key to Feedback_Types/Categories)
  - `Description` (Prayer text)
  - `Entry_Title` (Prayer title)
  - `Date_Submitted`
  - `Approved` (Boolean - requires staff approval before public display)
  - `Ongoing_Need` (Boolean)

- **Feedback_Types** - Prayer categories
  - `Feedback_Type_ID` (Primary Key)
  - `Feedback_Type` (Category name, e.g., "Prayer Request", "Praise Report")

**Custom Tables (Created by this widget - see `/database/schema.sql`):**
- **Feedback_Entry_User_Responses** - Tracks who prayed for what
  - `Feedback_Entry_User_Response_ID` (Primary Key)
  - `Feedback_Entry_ID` (Foreign Key to Feedback_Entries)
  - `Contact_ID` (Who prayed)
  - `Response_Type_ID` (1=Prayed, 2=Still Praying, 3=Celebrate, etc.)
  - `Response_Date` (When they prayed)
  - `Response_Text` (Optional encouraging message)
  - Enables features: prayer counts, streaks, prayer history, encouraging messages

- **Feedback_Response_Types** - Types of responses (lookup table)
  - `Response_Type_ID` (Primary Key)
  - `Response_Type` (e.g., "Prayed", "Celebrate", "Amen")
  - `Applicable_To_Feedback_Types` (Which categories can use this response)

- **Feedback_Entry_Updates** - Updates from prayer requesters
  - `Feedback_Entry_Update_ID` (Primary Key)
  - `Feedback_Entry_ID` (Which prayer)
  - `Update_Text` (Update/testimony text)
  - `Is_Answered` (Mark prayer as answered)

**Custom Stored Procedures:**
- `api_Custom_Feedback_With_Responses_JSON` - Get prayers with response counts
- `api_Custom_User_Response_Stats_JSON` - Get user prayer stats (total, streak, today)

### API Patterns

**Table Lookup Convention:**
To fetch related data, MP uses the pattern `TableName_ID_Table.FieldName`:
```typescript
// Example: Get prayer with contact name and category
$select: 'Feedback_ID,Contact_ID_Table.Display_Name,Feedback_Type_ID_Table.Feedback_Type,Description'
```

**Filtering:**
```typescript
$filter: 'Approved = 1 AND Feedback_Type_ID = 2'
$orderby: 'Date_Submitted DESC'
$top: 10
```

## Features Implemented

1. **Prayer Submission Form**
   - Title, description, category selection
   - Ongoing need toggle
   - Zod validation with React Hook Form
   - Auto-submits with logged-in user's Contact ID

2. **Prayer Wall**
   - Two view modes: Stack (swipe) and List
   - Swipe right to mark as "prayed for" with optional encouraging message
   - Swipe left to dismiss/skip
   - Filter by category and search
   - Only shows approved prayers
   - Real-time prayer counts from database

3. **Prayer Tracking & Stats**
   - **Prayer Stats Dashboard**: Total prayers, current streak, prayers today
   - **My Prayers**: View your submitted prayers and how many people prayed
   - **People I've Prayed For**: History of prayers you've prayed for with your messages
   - All powered by custom `Feedback_Entry_User_Responses` table

4. **Encouraging Messages**
   - Optional message when clicking "Pray"
   - Dialog appears before submitting prayer
   - Stored in `Response_Text` field
   - Displayed in "People I've Prayed For" section

5. **Approval Workflow**
   - New prayers start with `Approved = false`
   - Staff can approve via API: `POST /api/prayers/[id]/approve`
   - Only staff members (checked via `isStaff()` function) can approve

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first with Tailwind CSS v4
   - Smooth animations with Framer Motion
   - Touch-friendly swipe gestures

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run development server (port 3002)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm build

# Run production server
npm start

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Environment Variables

See `.env` file for configuration. Key variables:
- `MINISTRY_PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth client ID (TM.Widgets)
- `MINISTRY_PLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth client secret
- `MINISTRY_PLATFORM_BASE_URL` - MP API base URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MP_WIDGETS_AUTH_ENDPOINT` - MP widget auth validation endpoint
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - App URL (http://localhost:3002 for dev)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` - Prayer

## Embedding on WordPress

1. Add MP widgets script to page/template:
```html
<script id="MPWidgets" src="https://my.woodsidebible.org/widgets/dist/MPWidgets.js"></script>
```

2. Add MP login widget:
```html
<mpp-user-login></mpp-user-login>
```

3. Embed Next.js app (configure CORS on Vercel for your domain)

## Important Notes

- This widget does NOT use NextAuth for session management
- Authentication is entirely handled by MP's login widget
- Token is read from localStorage on the client side
- The middleware from the Template should be disabled or modified since we're not using NextAuth sessions
- All API routes expect an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

## Testing

To test locally:
1. Ensure MP is accessible and credentials are correct in `.env`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Open browser and set localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('mpp-widgets_AuthToken', 'YOUR_VALID_MP_TOKEN');
   ```
4. Refresh the page - you should see prayers if your token is valid

## Known Limitations

- Currently no way to track WHO prayed for a prayer (could add custom table)
- Swipe dismissal is only client-side (doesn't persist)
- No real-time updates (would require webhooks or polling)
- Approval must be done via API or custom admin interface

## Outstanding TODOs

### ðŸ”´ High Priority - Database/Stored Procedure

#### 1. Staff Role Detection
**Location:** `/database/unified-prayer-widget-proc.sql:184-191`

**Issue:** Currently defaults to non-staff for all users, which prevents staff-only visibility filtering.

**Solution Needed:**
```sql
-- Need to implement staff check, e.g.:
SELECT @Is_Staff = CASE WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM dp_Users u
    INNER JOIN dp_User_Security_Roles usr ON u.User_ID = usr.User_ID
    WHERE u.Contact_ID = @ContactID
    AND usr.Security_Role_ID IN (1, 2, 3) -- Replace with actual staff role IDs
) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END;
```

**Impact:** Staff users cannot see prayers marked as "Staff Only" until this is implemented.

#### 2. Visibility Level Mapping
**Location:** `/database/unified-prayer-widget-proc.sql:275-281`

**Issue:** Visibility levels are hardcoded assumptions:
- 4 = Public
- 3 = Members Only
- 2 = Staff Only
- 1 = Private

**Solution:** Verify these IDs match your MinistryPlatform `Visibility_Levels` table and update if needed.

#### 3. Care Outcome ID for Answered Prayers
**Location:** `/database/unified-prayer-widget-proc.sql:286-287`

**Issue:** Currently marks any prayer with a non-NULL `Care_Outcome_ID` as answered.

**Solution:** Verify which Care_Outcome_ID values mean "answered" in your MP instance (e.g., `CASE WHEN f.Care_Outcome_ID IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`).

#### 4. Campus Filter Implementation
**Location:** `/database/unified-prayer-widget-proc.sql:401-404`

**Issue:** Campus filtering is disabled because `Congregation_ID` doesn't exist in `Contacts` table.

**Solution:** Determine correct field for campus filtering and implement once identified.

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority - User-Facing Features

// Optimistic update pattern used throughout
setPrayerCount(optimisticCount);  // Update UI immediately
try {
  const result = await apiCall();  // Confirm in background
  setPrayerCount(result.count);   // Sync with server
} catch (error) {
  setPrayerCount(previousCount);  // Rollback on error
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/prayer/PrayerForm.tsx` - Optimistic submission
- `src/components/prayer/PrayerCard.tsx` - Enhanced pray animation
- `src/components/prayer/MyPrayers.tsx` - Shimmer effect, delete with undo, edit optimistically
- `src/app/(app)/page.tsx` - Optimistic state management

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority - Security & Code Cleanup

#### 10. âœ… COMPLETED: PostMessage Origin Verification
**Status:** Implemented and deployed

**What was done:**
- Added origin whitelist to postMessage handler in `/src/app/(app)/page.tsx`
- Rejects messages from untrusted origins with console warning
