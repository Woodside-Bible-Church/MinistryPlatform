# Prayer Widget - Recent Changes

## Summary of Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Created:** `MINISTRY_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION.md` - A complete guide for MP + Next.js integration patterns
  - JsonResult stored procedure pattern
  - @ parameter prefix requirement for SQL
  - Double-nested array response handling
  - Common errors and solutions
  - Debugging tips and best practices
- **Updated:** `CLAUDE.md` - Enhanced with references to the integration guide and updated feature list

### 2. Target Date Field (Replaces Ongoing Need Checkbox)
- **SQL Migration:** `database/add-target-date.sql`
  - Added `Target_Date` column to `Feedback_Entries` table
  - Updated stored procedure to include Target_Date field
  - Smart sorting: prioritizes prayers with upcoming target dates
- **Form Update:** `src/components/prayer/PrayerForm.tsx`
  - Replaced "Ongoing Need" checkbox with date picker
  - Date picker only allows future dates
  - Logic: If no target date provided, automatically marks as Ongoing_Need
  - Better UX with clear explanation text
- **Card Display:** `src/components/prayer/PrayerCard.tsx`
  - Shows target dates with relative time ("Tomorrow", "In 3 days", etc.)
  - Target dates displayed as badge with üéØ emoji
  - Past dates show "Was Oct 15" format

### 3. Category Selection Improvements
- **Changed from:** Dropdown menu
- **Changed to:** Radio button selection with visual cards
- **Benefits:**
  - Clearer choice between Prayer Request and Praise Report
  - More touch-friendly on mobile
  - Visual descriptions for each type
  - Default selection (Prayer Request)
  - Matches the "only 2 options" use case perfectly

### 4. Improved Section Names
More engaging and less clinical wording:

| Old Name | New Name | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Prayer Wall (header) | Prayer & Praise | More inclusive, emphasizes both needs |
| My Prayers | My Requests | Less redundant, clearer ownership |
| People I've Prayed For | Prayer Partners | Warmer, relational language |
| Prayer Wall (section) | Community Needs | More welcoming, emphasizes community |

Taglines also updated to be more engaging:
- "Share burdens, celebrate victories" (header)
- "Track your prayer requests and see who's lifting you up" (My Requests)
- "See who you've been standing with in prayer" (Prayer Partners)
- "Join others in lifting up these requests and celebrating answered prayers" (Community Needs)

### 5. Reduced Redundant Text on Prayer Cards
**Before:**
```
[Prayer Request Badge]
"Prayer Request from Richardson, Carla"
```

**After:**
```
[Prayer Request Badge]
"Healing for Surgery"      ‚Üê Just the title
From Carla                 ‚Üê Subtitle only if title exists
```

**Logic:**
- Badge shows type (Prayer Request / Praise Report)
- Title shows the actual request title
- Contact name shown as subtitle ("From {FirstName}")
- If no title provided, contact name becomes the title
- Eliminates redundancy while maintaining clarity

### 6. Fixed Card Width Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Cards in different sections had different widths
- MyPrayers: `max-w-4xl` ‚úÖ
- PrayerList: `max-w-4xl` ‚úÖ
- PeoplePrayedFor: No max-width ‚ùå (full-width)

**Solution:** Added `max-w-4xl mx-auto` wrapper to all PeoplePrayedFor return paths
- Now all sections use consistent `max-w-4xl` container
- Unified visual appearance across the entire page

## Files Modified

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ `MINISTRY_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION.md` (new)
- ‚úÖ `CLAUDE.md` (updated)
- ‚úÖ `CHANGES.md` (this file, new)

### Database
- ‚úÖ `database/add-target-date.sql` (new migration)

### Components
- ‚úÖ `src/components/prayer/PrayerForm.tsx`
  - Radio buttons for category selection
  - Date picker for Target_Date
  - Updated form validation schema
  - Logic to set Ongoing_Need based on Target_Date

- ‚úÖ `src/components/prayer/PrayerCard.tsx`
  - Added Target_Date to interface
  - Removed redundant text (no "Prayer Request from..." in title)
  - Contact name as subtitle or title depending on Entry_Title
  - Target date badge with relative time formatting
  - New `formatTargetDate()` function

- ‚úÖ `src/components/prayer/PeoplePrayedFor.tsx`
  - Added `max-w-4xl mx-auto` container wrapper
  - Consistent width across all states (loading, empty, loaded)

- ‚úÖ `src/app/(app)/page.tsx`
  - Updated main header: "Prayer & Praise"
  - Updated section names and taglines
  - More engaging, less clinical language

## Next Steps

### For the User:
1. **Run the SQL migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute: database/add-target-date.sql
   ```

2. **Clear MinistryPlatform cache:**
   - Administration ‚Üí Database Cache ‚Üí Clear Cache
   - Wait 30 seconds

3. **Verify the changes:**
   - Test the prayer submission form with new date picker
   - Check that target dates appear on prayer cards
   - Verify card widths are consistent
   - Test the new radio button category selection

4. **Optional:** Review and customize section names if desired

### Potential Future Enhancements:
- Add color coding for prayers near their target date
- Send notifications when target dates are approaching
- Show "days until" count on the card
- Filter prayers by "upcoming this week"
- Archive prayers past their target date (with option to extend)

## Technical Notes

### Radio Group Component
The form now uses `@/components/ui/radio-group` from shadcn/ui. If this component doesn't exist, you'll need to add it:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add radio-group
```

Or manually create it following the shadcn/ui pattern.

### Target Date Logic
- If user provides a target date ‚Üí `Ongoing_Need = false`
- If user leaves date blank ‚Üí `Ongoing_Need = true`
- Stored procedure prioritizes:
  1. Prayers with upcoming target dates (soonest first)
  2. Ongoing needs
  3. Recent submissions

### Breaking Changes
‚ö†Ô∏è **Form field change:** The form now sends `Target_Date` and derives `Ongoing_Need` automatically. Old submissions with just `Ongoing_Need = true` will still work fine (they'll show the "Ongoing" badge).
