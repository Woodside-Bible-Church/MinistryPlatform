# NextJS Projects

This folder contains full-stack or front-end applications built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for MinistryPlatform-related tools and integrations.

Each subfolder should represent a standalone Next.js project.

## Example Projects

- `Template/` – Authentication wrapper and starter app for MinistryPlatform
- `Events/` – Event-facing tools
- `Tools/` – Admin or internal dashboards

> Keep each Next.js app self-contained with its own `package.json`, config files, and environment setup.
