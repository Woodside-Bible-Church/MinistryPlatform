# Custom Widgets

This folder includes lightweight, JavaScript-based widgets that run client-side and enhance MinistryPlatform pages or embed into external sites.

Widgets may be built using vanilla JS, jQuery, or frameworks like LiquidJS.

## Examples

- `SermonSeries/` – Displays sermon series dynamically
- `GroupFinder/` – Interactive filtering for group search
- `CafeMenu/` – Internal digital signage / cafe menu widget

> Each widget should live in its own subfolder and include a `README.md`, JS/CSS, and optional HTML templates.
